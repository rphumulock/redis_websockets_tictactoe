WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived TCP connection. Hereâ€™s a technical breakdown of how WebSockets work, from start to end:

---

## **1. Establishing the WebSocket Connection**

### **a. The Initial HTTP Request**

- The WebSocket connection begins as an **HTTP request**.
- The client (e.g., browser) sends an HTTP request with the `Upgrade` header to indicate it wants to switch protocols from HTTP to WebSocket.
- Example of a WebSocket handshake request:

  ```
  GET /chat HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com:80
  Upgrade: websocket
  Connection: Upgrade
  Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==
  Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
  ```

  Key headers:

  - `Upgrade`: Indicates the protocol switch to WebSocket.
  - `Connection`: Ensures the connection is persistent and eligible for protocol upgrade.
  - `Sec-WebSocket-Key`: A base64-encoded random key, unique to the connection.
  - `Sec-WebSocket-Version`: Specifies the WebSocket protocol version (currently 13).

### **b. The Server's HTTP Response**

- If the server accepts the WebSocket upgrade, it responds with a **101 Switching Protocols** status code.
- Example response:
  ```
  HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
  Upgrade: websocket
  Connection: Upgrade
  Sec-WebSocket-Accept: s3pPLMBiTxaQ9kYGzzhZRbK+xOo=
  ```
  Key headers:
  - `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`: A hashed value created by the server using the `Sec-WebSocket-Key` from the client. It verifies the handshake's integrity.

#### **Technical Process for Validation**

- The server takes the `Sec-WebSocket-Key`, appends a GUID (`258EAFA5-E914-47DA-95CA-C5AB0DC85B11`), hashes it using SHA-1, and encodes it in base64 to generate `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`.

### **c. TCP Connection Upgrade**

- Once the handshake is complete, the connection is upgraded to a WebSocket connection over TCP. Both client and server can now exchange WebSocket frames instead of HTTP messages.

---

## **2. Framing and Communication**

### **a. WebSocket Frame Structure**

WebSockets use frames for communication. Frames allow WebSockets to efficiently send small chunks of data.

#### **Structure of a WebSocket Frame**:

| Bit      | Field            | Description                                                                   |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | FIN              | Indicates if this is the final fragment of the message.                       |
| 3        | RSV1, RSV2, RSV3 | Reserved for future extensions.                                               |
| 4        | Opcode           | Defines the frame type (e.g., text, binary, close).                           |
| 1        | Mask             | Indicates if the payload is masked (client messages are always masked).       |
| 7        | Payload Length   | Length of the payload (up to 125 bytes, with extensions for longer payloads). |
| Variable | Masking Key      | A 4-byte key used to mask the payload (only for client-to-server).            |
| Variable | Payload Data     | The actual data being sent.                                                   |

#### **Common Opcodes**:

- `0x1`: Text frame.
- `0x2`: Binary frame.
- `0x8`: Close connection.
- `0x9`: Ping.
- `0xA`: Pong.

---

### **b. Client-to-Server Communication**

1. **Masking**:
   - The client sends masked frames for security.
   - The server must unmask the frames before processing the payload.
2. **Sending Messages**:
   - Messages are sent as `TEXT` or `BINARY` frames, depending on the content.

---

### **c. Server-to-Client Communication**

1. **Unmasked Frames**:

   - The server sends frames without masking.
   - The client directly interprets the payload.

2. **Broadcasting**:
   - The server can broadcast a message by sending the same frame to multiple connected clients.

---

## **3. Persistent Connection**

### **a. Full-Duplex Communication**

- Unlike HTTP, where a request triggers a response, WebSockets allow both the client and server to independently send messages at any time.

### **b. Long-Lived Connection**

- The connection stays open unless explicitly closed by the client or server, or if thereâ€™s a network interruption.

---

## **4. Closing the WebSocket Connection**

### **a. Initiating the Close**

- Either the client or server can initiate a close by sending a **Close Frame** (`0x8`).
- The closing frame can optionally include a **close code** and a **reason**.

### **b. Close Codes**

| Code | Meaning                                  |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1000 | Normal closure.                          |
| 1001 | Going away (e.g., server shutting down). |
| 1002 | Protocol error.                          |
| 1003 | Unsupported data.                        |
| 1006 | Abnormal closure (no close frame sent).  |

### **c. Acknowledgment**

- The receiver of the close frame responds with its own close frame, and the TCP connection is terminated.

---

## **5. Error Handling and Reconnection**

### **a. Errors**

- Network interruptions or malformed frames can result in errors.
- WebSocket connections are designed to detect errors and terminate gracefully.

### **b. Reconnection**

- If a WebSocket connection is lost, the client can implement logic to retry the connection after a delay.

---

## **Technical Comparison**

| Feature       | WebSocket                    | HTTP                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Protocol Type | Full-duplex, bidirectional   | Request/Response, unidirectional |
| Latency       | Low (persistent connection)  | High (connection per request)    |
| Use Cases     | Real-time apps (chat, games) | REST APIs, static content        |

---

## **Summary**

- WebSockets begin with an HTTP handshake, upgrading to a persistent TCP connection.
- Frames provide an efficient way to transmit data with minimal overhead.
- WebSockets enable real-time, low-latency communication, making them ideal for applications like chat, gaming, and live updates.

No, WebSockets are **not confined to the six-connections-per-browser-tab limit** that applies to traditional HTTP requests. While WebSockets are initiated over HTTP, once the WebSocket handshake is completed and the connection is upgraded to a WebSocket connection, it operates outside the standard HTTP request limits.

Here's why:

---

### **1. Difference Between HTTP and WebSocket After the Handshake**

- **HTTP Connections**: Browsers often enforce a limit on the number of simultaneous HTTP connections to a single domain (usually 6 per browser tab). This is a legacy feature intended to prevent overloading a server.
- **WebSocket Connections**: After the WebSocket handshake, the connection becomes a persistent, full-duplex TCP connection. It is no longer managed by the same rules as HTTP.

---

### **2. WebSocket Connection Limits**

WebSocket connections are limited by:

1. **Browser-Specific Limits**: Each browser has its own limit for the total number of WebSocket connections, but these limits are generally much higher than HTTP's (e.g., 200-500 per domain in most modern browsers).
2. **Server Resource Limits**: The serverâ€™s capacity (e.g., memory, CPU) often becomes the primary bottleneck for handling a large number of WebSocket connections.
3. **Operating System Limits**: There may be limits on the maximum number of file descriptors or sockets that a server process can manage simultaneously.

---

### **3. Practical Considerations**

- While WebSockets donâ€™t adhere to the 6-connection-per-domain rule, browsers and servers still impose practical limits on the number of simultaneous WebSocket connections for performance and security reasons.
- For instance, attempting to create thousands of WebSocket connections in a single browser tab could lead to browser resource exhaustion.

---

### **4. Browser-Specific WebSocket Limits**

Here are some typical WebSocket limits in modern browsers:
| Browser | Max WebSocket Connections (Approximate) |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| Chrome | 200 per domain |
| Firefox | 200 per domain |
| Safari | 65,536 (limited by OS and memory) |
| Edge | 256 per domain |

---

### **5. Conclusion**

WebSockets operate independently of the 6-connection limit for HTTP because:

- They upgrade the connection to a persistent TCP channel.
- They are designed for long-lived, real-time communication.
- Browsers and servers impose their own WebSocket-specific limits.

If you plan to handle a very high number of WebSocket connections, focus on optimizing your server's scalability using strategies like load balancing, horizontal scaling, and efficient resource management. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into these topics! ðŸš€
